# Movie-Dataset-Analysis
This project uses a movie dataset with many nulls and inconsistencies. The data is first cleaned and transformed, then loaded into a SQL database for Future uses. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover trends, followed by a summary of key insights

# Movie Dataset Analysis Project

In this project, we will work with a movie dataset to derive valuable insights. The steps involved in the analysis are:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and ensure consistency.
2. **Loading Dataset in SQL**: Load the cleaned dataset for further use.
3. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarize key stats like mean, median, std dev for rating, score, budget, and gross.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation) to explore patterns.
5. **Insights**: Extract key insights like rating trends, budget vs gross, and genre popularity.

This project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and provide actionable insights based on the movie data.
